<h1>LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB HISTORY</h1>

<p><img class="float" src="pictures/Liverpool-logos.jpg" alt="picture 
of liverpool" width="200px" height="200px "/>Liverpool football club 
was was founded on June 3rd year 1892 due to a misunderstanding 
between <b>John Houlding</b> (owner of the anfield land which was 
formally Everton stadium) and the Everton committee. This caused 
Everton to move to their own staduim which is as we
all know to be Goodison park. 
John Houlding then started his own club at the anfield stadium 
and named it <b>Everton fc and Athletic Grounds Ltd</b> but this
 name was not approved by the football league committe so it was renamed
as <b><i>LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB.</i></b></p>
<p>The team won the <a href="#" alt="">Lancaschire league</a> and joined the football league 
second division at the start of the 1893/1894 season and finished in 
the first place to be promoted to the first division of the league
which it won in the year 1901 and 1906.
They went on to reach their first FA Cup final in 1914 losing to Burnley and won consecutive league titles in 1922 and 1923, but did not win another trophy until
1946-47 season.
Fews years after playing in the first division, the club was relegated to the second division which prompted the manager to be sacked and the 
<strong>GREAT Bill Shankly</strong> was appointed.
Upon His arrival, he released a total of 24 players. 
Shankly had alongside him, his backroom staff that he discussed strategies with. They are: <strong>Joe Fagan</strong>, <strong>Reuben Bennett</strong> and 
<strong>Bob Paisley</strong>.
These people helped reshape the team.</p>

<p>The club was promoted back to the first division in 1962 and won it again in 1964 for the first time in 17 years. In 1965, we finally won our first 
FA cup trophy, the success story continued the follow season when we won the first division title again and entered the european cup final only
to be defeated by Dortmund. The trophy galore continued for years until BILL SHANKLY decided to retire and his assistance Bob Paisley took over the management of the 
club. During Paisley 9 season in charge of the club, liverpool won a total of 20 trophies which is considered as the club most successful era.
The trophies Paisley won include three european cups, a uefa cup, six league titles and three consecutive league cups, the only trophy he never got to win was the
FA cup</p>
